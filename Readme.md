Dear Teacher,

UPDATE: after some rest, things became clearer in my head, so I decided to give it another go today and fix some quirks I left yesterday in my code.

As you can see in my commit history, I was finnaly able to fully implement everything today so I can finally close those annoying open tabs in my head haha

Cheers!
